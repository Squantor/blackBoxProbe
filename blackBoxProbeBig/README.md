# blackBoxProbe
A boxed clone of the [black magic probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki). The black magic probe hardware is good but I would like something more then just a bare PCB. This project is here to solve that need. 
Do note, support the people at blacksphere technologies by buying their excellent probe. 
I have made this probe to have a nicer boxed version that I can use and is somewhat easier to solder as it only contains 0603 and components with legs like QFP's or TSSOP's. This does make it a bit bigger.
## DONE
* Schematic entry, copied from [black magic probe V2.1](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki/files/bmpm_v2_1c_schematic.pdf).
* Layout completed, board outline matches a [Hammond 1551R](http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/1551R.pdf)
## In progress
* Wait for one day before respinning
## TODO
* Production of PCB's and stencil
* Tests and fixes
* pictures
* writeup
* Smaller boxed version that fits a [hammond 1551G](http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/1551G.pdf)
