# BlackBoxProbe Micro variant
A boxed clone of the 
[black magic probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki). The 
black magic probe hardware is good but I would like something more then just a bare PCB and a more suitable connector for the serial connection. This project is here to solve that need. 
Do note, support the people at blacksphere technologies by buying their excellent probe. 
I have made this probe to have a nicer boxed version that I can use. This version has mostly 0402 components and is housed in a smaller box.
## DONE
* Schematic entry, copied from [black magic probe V2.1](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki/files/bmpm_v2_1c_schematic.pdf).
## In progress
